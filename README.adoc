Visualize, explore, and compare multi-dimensional data on the web.

TODO: Screenshot

SAAV offers:

* A *Quality* view, which visualizes quantitative, comparable dimensions of your data.
It uses nested *parallel coordinate* visualizations to explore data dimensions across hierarchical levels.
Mean values are calculated ("aggregated") for each hierarchical level, eventually producing an overall *ranking* of your data entities.
Customizable weights control how dimensions contribute to the ranking.

* A *Profile* view, which visualizes dimensions of your data for which a mathematical comparison does _not_ make sense.
Using a *bubble visualization*, this view allows to explore data dimensions with respect to similarity.

* An *Expert Configuration* panel to assign data dimensions to views (Quality vs. Profile) and control aggregation weights.

* An exportable *PDF* report of your analysis

# Getting Started

If you just want to get a feel for SAAV, use it with demo data http://fhnw-saav.github.io/saav/[right here and now].

If you would like to load your own data, read on to learn about supported input data.

# Input Data

## Format

SAAV expects a CSV data matrix with the following columns (order matters):

`"Entity","Hierarchy","Reviewer","Value"`

* *Entity*: The names of the things you are comparing (e.g. "Project 1", "John Doe", "Age Group < 20")
* *Hierarchy*: The hierarchical path; three levels, separated by ":::" (e.g. "Language:::French:::Grade")
* *Reviewer*: An identifier of an individual measurement (e.g. "Reviewer 1")
* *Value*: The actual value (parsed as http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.x/scala/Double.html[`Double`])

TODO: Example Input Data

## Auto-Loading From URL

In addition to loading data from file via "drag & drop", SAAV supports auto-loading data from any URL:

`http://fhnw-saav.github.io/saav/?dataFileUrl=http://example-domain.com/data.csv`

TIP: This is particularly convenient if you want to embed SAAV on your website (e.g. in an `iframe`), with all data already loaded.

# Config Data

SAAV optionally supports a file-based configuration to provide application defaults and control input data validation.
Specifically, it allows to

* Customize an analysis *title*
* Constrain the range of *allowed values* (aborting the import process upon violations)
* Specify default *weights* ("Quality" vs "Profile" view; aggregation weights)
* Specify an expected *hierarchy* (detection of input data mismatches)

## Format

TODO: Document JSON format

## Loading From URL

A SAAV config file can be loaded from any URL:

`http://fhnw-saav.github.io/saav/?configFileUrl=http://example-domain.com/config.json`

# Background Information

SAAV was originally developed to http://www.performances-recherche.ch/projects/software-application-to-analyse-and-visualise-research-output-in-the-humanities-and-social-sciences[analyse and visualise research output in the humanities and social sciences] (SAAV).
Development was a joint effort between the https://www.unilu.ch[University of Lucerne] and the http://www.fhnw.ch/[University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland FHNW].
The software was presented at the final SUK P3 Conference (November 2016; link:docs/poster-saav-2016.pdf[Poster]).
