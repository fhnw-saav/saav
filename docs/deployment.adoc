# Deployment

How to create a tagged non-SNAPSHOT release and deploy it via http://fhnw-saav.github.io/saav/[GitHub pages].

## Pre-Requisites

* Up-to-date clone of `saav` repo (i.e. `git pull` first)
* No changes in working directory

## Versioning

The project version is managed via `version.sbt`.

If your current `version.sbt` is e.g. at `1.2.3-SNAPSHOT`:

* No change required to deploy `1.2.3`
* Manual edit + commit required to deploy `1.3.0`

## Deployment

To release and deploy:

`sbt deploy`

Assuming e.g. a version `1.2.3-SNAPSHOT`, this will:

* Strip the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix (`1.2.3`)
* Tag the repo (`v1.2.3`)
* Compile and assemble all site artifacts (JS, HTML, CSS)
* Include a `version.txt` (containing `1.2.3`)
* Add site to `gh-pages` branch
* Commit and push `gh-pages` branch
* Upgrade `version.sbt` to next SNAPSHOT (`1.2.4-SNAPSHOT`)
* Commit and push `master` (including new tag)
