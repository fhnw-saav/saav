# Architecture & Design

SAAV is a single-page web application.
It is written in http://www.scala-js.org/[Scala.js], using the https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react[scalajs-react] framework.
Scala.js compiles to JavaScript (JS).
When deployed, SAAV consists of just a few static HTML, CSS, and JS files.
There is no application server, just a web server, serving these static files.

## Model-View-Update

SAAV is based on the Model-View-Update architecture (like http://redux.js.org/[Redux] or http://elm-lang.org/[Elm]).
It uses the following technologies in the individual layers:

### Model

The model layer is responsible for representing application state.
All model classes are written in plain Scala.
A _domain model_ is created by importing data from a CSV file.
The domain model is then enriched with UI state (colors, selections etc.).
This enriched model is known as the _application model_.
It encapsulates all state to be rendered by the view.

### View

The view is responsible for rendering the application model.
In a web app, "rendering" means "creating HTML".

SAAV uses https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react[React] to create HTML.
footnote:[In contrast to classical MVC frameworks like e.g. Angular, React is really _only_ the view layer.
http://blog.andrewray.me/reactjs-for-stupid-people["ReactJS For Stupid People"] explains this in detail.]

The view is also responsible for triggering model changes based on user interactions.
It does never change the model directly, but asks the update function ("the circuit") to do so.

### Update ("The Circuit")

The circuit holds the central model which it updates in response to actions dispatched by the view.
SAAV uses the https://github.com/ochrons/diode[diode] library for application model management.
Starting out with an initial model, it performs a reduce operation (`(Model, Action) => Model`) over the series of all actions (hence the name "Redux").
Whenever the model changes, the circuit asks the view to re-render it.

## Principles
### Immutability

At the core of the application is the `SaavModel`, a completely immutable hierarchy of Scala case classes, responsible for storing all application state.
Because the model is immutable, a new model copy is created whenever a change is requested.
SAAV uses the https://github.com/ochrons/diode[diode] library for application model management:

* Storing the currently valid model
* Accepting change requests in the form of actions
* Triggering action handlers to create a new model with the requested change
* Notifying listeners to re-render the views based on the new model

In SAAV, the central class managing all these aspects is called `SaavCircuit`.

### Action Handlers

Whenever the model must change (e.g. as a result of user interaction) such a change is requested in the form of an action.
Actions are represented by simple Scala case classes.
They are dispatched to the `SaavCircuit`, which then triggers an action handler to actually create a new model with the requested change.
In other words: Based on the current model and an action, an action handler creates a new model.
For the sake of modularity, SAAV doesn't just use one action handler to transform the whole `SaavModel`.
Instead, it uses different action handlers, each one being responsible to transform just a part of the model (e.g. the `EntitySelectionHandler` is responsible for updating the `EntitySelectionModel`, a tiny part of the `SaavModel`)
The metaphor of "zooming" is used for this approach: An action handler is zoomed into a part of the model.
To support zooming, each action handler must define two functions for its own construction:

* `modelGet`: Given a complete model, this function returns the part of the model which needs updating
* `modelSet`: Given a complete (old) model and the part updated by the handler, this function returns a complete (new) model containing the changed part.

After a handler is constructed, it is registered with the `SaavCircuit` in order to be notified about incoming actions.
By pattern matching on specific actions, each handler implementation decides how to update the model part it is zoomed into.

### Virtual DOM

The view is responsible for creating a DOM tree based on the application model.
Whenever the model changes, the DOM tree must be changed as well.
Changing the DOM has expensive consequences, because the browser must potentially adjust layouts ("reflow") and perform repaints.
In order to minimize DOM changes, the React view layer does not create a real DOM, but a virtual one.
On each model update, it diffs the old virtual DOM with the new virtual DOM and is able to minimize the real DOM manipulations.
This diffing is very efficient thanks to the immutability of the virtual DOM (immutability guarantees that reference equality implies "deep" equality).

Certain operations cannot be performed solely relying on the virtual DOM.
It is e.g. not possible to calculate actual element widths without applying CSS and calculating the layout.
scalajs-react provides hooks to execute code at a time where the real DOM is guaranteed to be available (`componentDidMount()`).
It also allows to reference elements in the virtual DOM such that they are identifiable once available in the real DOM (`Ref`).

### CSS

SAAV uses https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss[ScalaCSS] for type safe CSS.
This allows to catch certain errors at compile time and supports concepts that or not possible in standard CSS (e.g. style that depends on input).
